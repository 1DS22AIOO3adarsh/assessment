# ðŸ“„ RAG Streamlit App

A simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that lets you **chat with your own documents** using a Streamlit interface powered by:

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Document Upload**  
   Upload multiple documents in `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` formats.

2. **Preprocessing & Chunking**  
   Files are processed into manageable text chunks using `split_documents()`.

3. **Vector Embedding & Indexing**  
   Chunks are encoded via Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and indexed with FAISS.

4. **Query Handling**  
   User questions are embedded and searched against the FAISS index.

5. **Answer Generation**  
   Gemini answers based **only on the retrieved chunks**. If nothing matches, it responds gracefully.

6. **Chat Logging**  
   Chat history is saved into a `.docx` file with clear structure.
